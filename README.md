## About Niptō

*Niptō* (νίπτω) is a Greek word meaning “to wash”—used in the New Testament to symbolize humility, preparation, and service. This project reflects those values through clean code, intentional design, and emotionally intelligent user experiences.

Created by Nyasha, *Niptō* is more than a portfolio—it's a philosophy of clarity, empathy, and modular creativity. Every component is crafted to serve, connect, and inspire.
